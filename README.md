# Django Training

All web apps need persist and retrieve data to be useful. You can use Django-ORM to access and update your persisted data. The business of retrieving and storing data can be done in multiple ways. This is a training module to help you determine which is the best way.


## Getting started
- Clone this repo
- Run `. script/bootstrap` to initialize dependencies and virtualenv (see more https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)
- Go to one of the exercises, eg `cd exercise/exercise_1`
- Run the test to see what was expected, eg `inv test -e1`
- Fix the implementation, eg `vim exercise/exercise_1/use_cases.py`
- Run the test to verify your solution, eg `inv test -e1`
